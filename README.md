# BetterCanvas
an intelligent Canvas command-line client

## About
BetterCanvas is an integration with the Canvas LMS. It was developed to address inefficiencies in remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. It compiles all assignments and mentioned events into a comprehensive calendar. To do so, it extracts dates from all communications through the platform and uses NLP to infer the significance of each date. It presents this calendar to the user.

BetterCanvas was developed in 2020 and has not been maintained since. As of 2024, the app remains functional. It could, however, fail or become obsolete at any time. Use it with these advisories in mind.

## Usage
```
$ python3 better_canvas.py
```
BetterCanvas will walk you through the quickstart.
